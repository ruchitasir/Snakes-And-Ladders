        <h2>Game Rules</h2>
        <ul>
            <li class="oddLi">
                Its a two player game. When the dice button is clicked, 
                player 1 moves on the board. He moves as many cells as the dice indicates.
                Ex. player 1 is at 52, dice showed 5. He will go to 57.
            </li>
            <li class="evenLi">
                After the player 1 moves, click the dice again for the next player to move. Next player
                will move as the dice indicates. Hit the dice button again for Player 1 to move. 
                Player 1 and 2 take turns to click the dice button.
            </li>
            <li class="oddLi">
                If the next position is occupied by other player. He gets bonus to walk one cell extra.
                For ex. Player 1 is at 4, he rolls 4. He goes to 4+4 = 8. On 8, there is another player
                so he moves to 8+1 = 9.
            </li>
            <li class="evenLi">
                If there is a ladder on the position where player is supposed to go, then he moves 
                up the ladder. For ex: a player at 8 rolls 5, goes to 13. On 13, there is a ladder 
                which ends at 16, so he climbs up the ladder.
                If on 16, there is another player, then he gets to move one cell extra. And his
                new position will be 17. If there is a ladder or a snake at 17, player still remains there.               
            </li>
            <li class="oddLi"> 
                If there is a snake on the position where player is supposed to go, then he moves 
                down to the position where the tail of snake ends. For ex: a player at 8 rolls 5, goes to 13. On 13, 
                there is a snake, whose tail is at 6, then he goes down to 6.
                If on 6, there is another player, then he gets to move one cell extra. And his
                new position will be 7. If there is a ladder or a snake at 7, player still remains there.
            </li>
            <li class="evenLi">
                If the position where player is supposed to go is occupied, he moves to next.
                On the next position, if there is a snake or a ladder, he will either move down or go up.
                For ex. Player is at 40, he rolls 6, at 46 there is another player. So, he goes to 47 but at 47, 
                there is a snake so he goes down to 34(snake's tail)or if there is a ladder, he goes to 
                55(ladder's top).       
            </li>
            <li class="oddLi">The player that reaches 100 first, wins the game. </li>
            <li class="evenLi">
                Once the player wins the game, there is an option to start the game again 
                through restart game button which shows up after the victory. The other option that shows up 
                is to come back to this page.
